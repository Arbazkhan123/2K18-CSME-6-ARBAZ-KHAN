<h3> Introduction</h3>
Chatbots are computer programs designed to
hold conversations with users using natural language [15]. Some of them
have human identities and personalities to make the conversation more
natural. Ranging from Twitter bots with random responses to more
complex counseling service agents, chatbots have become increasingly
common in recent years. According to Tsvetkova et al. [16], nearly half of
the online interactions between 2007 and 2015 involved a chatbot.

<h3> RESEARCH:</h3>
When talking about human-computer conversation, the
very first technologies like ELIZA (1966) and ALICE (1995) come to mind 
due to their importance. ELIZA was created to demonstrate that natural
conversation with a computer was possible, but failed to pass the Turing
test since its implementation was based on string matching and no
context was taken into account for the written responses. ALICE
introduced the famous AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup
Language),which uses pattern matching rules to give ‘meaning’ to the
actual words: topic..

<h3> METHDOLOGY:</h3>
 The main goal of our study is to examine what
chatbot developers are asking about. To achieve this goal, we resort to
analyze the developers’ discussions on Stack Overflow as it provides a
rich dataset and have been used by similar investigations in other
domains, such as concurrency [6], cryptography APIs [41], and deep
learning [30]. 
<h4> SUMMARY:</h4>
More than 50 years after Weinzebaum introduced the
first computer program to have a conversation with humans , chatbots
have become the main conduit between humans and services .
Potentialized by the recent advances in artificial intelligence and natural
language processing chatbots are the primary interface in a variety of
services, from smart homes and personal assistants ,to health care and
E-commerce Given how chatbots reduce the operational costs of
services, the usage of chatbots will only increase - experts predict that
85% of users’ interactions with services will be done through chatbots
by 2021. 
<h3> MOTIVATION:</h3>
Businesses constantly need to evolve
and adopt newer trends to succeed. These days
companies are implementing chatbots that help in
solving customer queries, improving communication,
and remote troubleshooting to enhance customer
experience.
<h3> RESULT:</h3>
 In this paper, we analyze Stack Overflow posts to identify
the most pressing issues facing chatbot development. We find that
developers discuss 12 chatbot-related topics that fall under five main
categories, namely Integration, Development, NLU, User Interaction, and
User Input. Chatbot developers are highly interested in posts that are
related to chatbot creation and integration into websites. On the other
hand, training the NLU model of the chatbot proves to be challenging
task for developers. We also find that chatbot practitioners show
considerable interest in understanding the behavior of NLUs, while also
seeking good recommendation regarding chatbot development
platforms and best practices. We believe that our results are useful to
the chatbot community as they guide future research to focus on the
more pressing and difficult aspects of chatbot development.
